        <p>Welcome to <a href="./index.html">FR33FL0W.com</a>! Here you will find a
          fine selection of my endeavours to produce some amazing portfolio content
          that will hopefully one day help me to get hired in this industry that I
          love so much to play around in. So much so that I sometimes stay up all
          night, forgetting to sleep as I try to finish a project.</p>
        <p>Let's generate some random words to go in here like banana and chickens
          and butter and all the good things like that.
        </p>
        <p>The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus),[4] sometimes referred to as
          the duck-billed platypus,[5] is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic
           to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is the sole
           living representative or monotypic taxon of its family Ornithorhynchidae
            and genus Ornithorhynchus, though a number of related species appear
            in the fossil record.
        </p>
        <p>Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant
          species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to
          live young.[6] Like other monotremes, the platypus has a sense of
          electrolocation, which it uses to detect prey in cloudy water.[7] It is
          one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a
          spur on the hind foot that delivers an extremely painful venom.
